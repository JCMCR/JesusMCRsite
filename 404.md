The page you were trying to view moved or does not exist --- perhaps you can [find it on the main site]({{ site.url }}), or maybe take a gander at our [wiki](http://mcr.jesus.cam.ac.uk/mcrwiki/).

<form name="redirect">

<script>
<!--
//change below target URL to your own
var targetURL="http://mcr.jesus.cam.ac.uk"

var countdownfrom=15

var currentsecond=document.redirect.redirect2.value=countdownfrom+1
function countredirect(){
if (currentsecond!=1){
currentsecond-=1
document.redirect.redirect2.value=currentsecond
}
else{
window.location=targetURL
return
}
setTimeout("countredirect()",1000)
