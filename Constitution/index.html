				<p>4. The President shall act as chair of all General Meetings. In his or her absence, the meeting shall be chaired by the Vice-President. Otherwise the first business of the meeting shall be to elect a Chair. If the President is the proposer of a motion, he or she will relinquish the Chair to the next most senior member of the Executive for the duration of consideration of that motion.</p>
				<p>5. Motions will be debated in the order they appear on the agenda. The Chair must give procedural motions immediate precedence over motions listed on the agenda. Procedural motions shall be put to the meeting in the same manner as ordinary motions of business. If passed they shall be binding upon the Chair.</p>
				<p>6. The following procedural motions may be put:</p>
					<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
					<p>(a) 'that X be heard';</p>
					<p>(b) 'that this matter be adjourned until the next General Meeting';</p>
					<p>(c) 'that this matter be referred to the Executive Committee';</p>
					<p>(d) 'that this motion be amended';</p>
					<p>(e) 'that this motion shall not be put to a vote';</p>
					<p>(f) 'that this motion shall immediately be put to a vote';</p>
					<p>(g) 'that this motion shall be voted on by secret ballot';</p>
					<p>(h) 'that this meeting shall immediately be closed'; and</p>
					<p>(i) 'that the Chair should step down'.</p>
					</div>
				<p>7. If the proposer of a motion is not present at the meeting it will be struck off the agenda. Once the proposer has spoken, the Chair shall call for anyone opposing the motion to make their case; and then any member may take the floor upon being recognised by the Chair. The Chair must recognise any member of the Executive indicating a desire to speak before he or she calls for a vote. The Chair shall have discretion to limit the length of all speeches, questions and answers. Once constructive debate has ended, the Chair will call for a vote.</p>
				<p>8. The vote shall normally be by a show of hands, but the vote shall instead be by a secret ballot if requested as a procedural motion. If voting on the motion is by secret ballot votes must be counted and announced at the meeting. The Chair and a second voting member appointed by the Chair will be responsible for counting the votes.</p>
				<p>9. A decision of a General Meeting will be binding upon the Executive of the MCR if it has been published on the agenda of the meeting and received a majority of the votes cast. If any member of the Executive feels unable to act according to such a mandate, he or she shall tender his or her resignation to the Secretary, or in the case of the Secretary, to the President.</p>
				<p>10. Minutes of General Meetings will be taken by the Secretary and circulated to all voting members within seven days of the meeting.</p>

				<h1>Finance</h1>
				<p>1. Income: All monies allocated by the College for the use of graduate students shall comprise the income of the MCR. This money will be received by the MCR directly from the College.</p>
				<p>2. The property and income of the MCR shall be applied solely towards the promotion of the aims of the MCR (as defined in Article 2) and no part of that property or income may be paid or otherwise distributed, directly or indirectly, to members of the MCR, except in good faith in the promotion of those aims.</p>
				<p>3. The MCR Treasurer will submit an annual budget, ratified by the Executive, to the Jesus College Senior Bursar in time for the July Jesus College Council meeting. Following ratification of this budget at the College Council meeting, the College will deposit the agreed amounts into the MCR current account for the forthcoming academic year.</p>
				<p>4. Internal Controls: The MCR will open and maintain both a current account, and an interest-bearing deposit account. The signatories to the accounts shall be the Senior Treasurer and the Treasurer of the MCR. All monies received from the College shall be paid into the current account. The balance of the current and deposit accounts should be maintained so as to make good use of the interest rates available, bearing in mind the costs incurred transferring money between accounts. Transfer of funds between current and deposit accounts may only be authorised by the signatories of the accounts,</p>
				<p>5. The Treasurer must obtain written authorisation from the Senior Treasurer before making any form of disbursement from either account for sums in excess of 100 pounds. Should the Treasurer or any other officer require reimbursement of expenses they have borne personally on behalf of the MCR, in a sum which exceeds 100 pounds, the Treasurer must always bring the matter to the attention of the Senior Treasurer, whose written authorisation must be obtained for any payment of this nature. Should the Treasurer fail to do so he or she shall be in breach of this constitution and disqualified from holding office within the terms of Article 7 above. If the Senior Treasurer is unavailable, the Senior Bursar may authorise such disbursements as would otherwise have been the responsibility of the Senior Treasurer. The Senior Treasurer will be informed of such payments.</p>
				<p>6. The Treasurer will hold a Payments Book, in which he or she will record every payment made from the MCR accounts, and every deposit received. This Payment Book will be submitted to the Senior Treasurer monthly for oversight.
</p>
				<p>7. No contract may be entered into by or on behalf of the MCR without the written authority of the Executive.</p>
				<p>8. With the exception of the Senior Treasurer, only the Treasurer shall be authorised to draw money from the bank accounts of the MCR, always being bound by and subject to the appropriate regulations of the University concerning the supervision by senior members of the financial administration of the clubs and societies of junior members of the University, including graduate students. The Treasurer will retain the chequebook of the MCR. The Treasurer will maintain the accounting records of the MCR, including the bank statements, invoices paid and cashbook.</p>
				<p>9. The Treasurer will be entitled to issue any single disbursement not exceeding three hundred pounds without recourse to the Executive: if however he or she has reason to believe the Executive would not approve any such expenditure, he or she may not issue the disbursement on his or her own authority and must instead call a meeting of the Executive. He or she does not need the support of another member of the Executive to call a meeting for such purposes.</p>
				<p>10. The Treasurer must submit a written summary of the accounts to the Executive and the Senior Treasurer at the conclusion of Michaelmas and Lent Full Terms. The Treasurer will prepare accounts annually and publish them on the notice board of the Graduate Room at least 48 hours before the Annual General Meeting in Easter Full Term. If members of the MCR are not content to accept the accounts as published in Easter Full Term they should seek satisfaction from the Treasurer in the first instance and may then call a general meeting in accordance with the provisions of Article 9.1(c).</p>
				<p>11. At the end of the financial year, the Treasurer will prepare the annual accounts for ratification by the Executive, and submit them for approval to the Senior Treasurer. The Treasurer will then send a copy signed by the Senior Treasurer to the Senior Bursar for submission to College Council and independent auditing.</p>
				<p>12. The Senior Treasurer:</p>
					<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
					<p>(a) shall be entitled to: examine the accounting records of the MCR, including any of the Treasurer’s working papers, in order to form an opinion on the accounts, and the Treasurer must make the accounting records of the MCR available to the Senior Treasurer upon receiving reasonable notice of his or her request;</p>
					<p>(b) shall be entitled: to require such explanations as he or she thinks necessary from officers of the MCR in forming an opinion of the accounts;</p>
					<p>(c) shall be entitled to: attend and speak at any meeting of the Executive MCR on any subject that directly concerns him or her as Senior Treasurer;</p>
					<p>(d) will signify his or her approval of the accounts in writing to the Executive. Should he or she form the opinion that the accounts are untrue or misleading he or she shall signify this disapproval to the Executive and call an extraordinary general meeting of the MCR. He or she will not need the agreement of the Executive or any other voting member to call a meeting in such circumstances.</p>

				<h1>Affiliation, Subscriptions and Donations to External Organisations</h1>
				<p>1. The MCR may affiliate, or pay a subscription, fee or donation, to an external organisation only if it publishes to all members, and to the College Council notice of its intention to do so, stating the name of the organisation, and the details of any subscription, fee or donation paid or proposed to be paid to it; and annually at the AGM a report stating the names of all the external organisations to which it is affiliated, or to which any subscription, fee or donation has been paid within the year covered by the report.</p>
