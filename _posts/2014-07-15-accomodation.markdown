Jesus College has a wide range of accommodation available to grads. In fact,
 we are lucky enough to be one of the few colleges that can offer the financial
 and social benefits of living in college for up to three years of a PhD.
 Accommodation at Jesus is priced at a very good rate by Cambridge standards
 and well maintained, not to mention the fact that most of our graduates live
 within 5 minutes walk of both the City Centre and our Grad Room is a great
 boost to fostering a sense of community.

Your room in first year will be assigned, but in later years grads are able to
 choose their accommodation based on personal preferences.  Each grad has up to
 three years eligibility for graduate accommodation (including your Masters year),
 but more can be offered if rooms are available.

All rooms and partner accommodation have internet connections (included in rents
 charged is unlimited wireless internet, via Edurom in all college housing, and
 50GB per month of incredibly fast wired internet). Utilities are charged in
 addition to the rent at a very competitive fixed rate. The Housekeeping
 Department regularly cleans the communal spaces in each house (kitchens,
   bathrooms and hallways), grads clean their own rooms and do their own
   washing-up and cleaning of cooking utensils. In addition, all accommodation
   has laundry facilities within each building, or less than a minutes walk away.
   While the college provides beds and standard furniture like desks and chairs,
   it does not supply bedding or cooking equipment.

Jesus Lane, Malcolm Street, Park Street and Lower Park Street are the roads that
 border the college. The majority of the buildings on these streets are owned by
 Jesus College. While some blocks are undergraduate only (including all the housing within
   the college gates), the grad housing can be broadly broken down into the
   seven areas described below.

## Jesus Lane

![Little Trinity]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/img/services/housing_jesuslane.jpg)

Jesus Lane is the road that the main entrance to Jesus College (called the ‘Chimney’) comes off.
 One side of the street is college housing; the other side is the College itself. The grad accommodation
 is clustered at either end of this road, with undergraduates in-between. The houses here tend to be two
 to three storeys, with large fenced gardens behind, and kitchens in the basement. A notable house on this street
 is number 49. It houses a large number of graduates and has a very large kitchen ideal for socialising.

## Little Trinity (16 Jesus Lane)

![Little Trinity]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/img/services/housing_400_289.jpg)

This grand old house sits at the end of Jesus Lane, directly opposite the ADC Theatre.
 Built in 1725, it has a great wooden staircase and several rooms still contain their wooden
 panelling and almost every room comes with its own quirky character. Despite its grandiose
 design, and the often strong community in the house, the building has small kitchens which
 can limit the social atmosphere.  The Annexe, a graduate couples unit, is also at this address.

## Park St

![Little Trinity]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/img/services/housing_park.jpg)

Park Street has central Cambridge on one side, and the college grounds on the other.
 The buildings are similar to, although a little smaller than the ones on Jesus Lane.
 As the houses on this street back on to the College’s lacrosse/hockey pitch, residents
 there also enjoy being 30 seconds walk from the College gym and squash courts.

## Lower Park St

![Little Trinity]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/img/services/housing_400_289.jpg)

The prettiest housing in college, these two storey houses back on to a college garden on one side,
 and either the Maypole Pub, a local school or Jesus Green on the other, depending on
 how far down the street you are. The houses here are small, and most have only three
 people in each house. Several couples’ units are also on this street.

## Marshall Court (off Jesus Lane)

![Little Trinity]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/img/services/housing_marshall.jpg)

Marshall Court is the newest block in college, with both couples’ flats and single study bedroom.
 All rooms in this block have ensuite bathrooms (decked out in Jesus themed tiles!).
 Rooms here can be small, but the fittings and views from the rooms down into Sidney Sussex
 College Master’s gardens are great. There is also large paved area for storing bikes.
 The 20 single bedrooms are spread through four staircases with communal kitchens in the basement.

## Maid’s Causeway

The furthest accommodation from Jesus (a full 0.3 miles or all of four minutes gentle stroll!),
 a couple of grad houses are located here. While like all areas, the individual room sizes vary,
 this street is home to a few truly gargantuan rooms. These buildings are the closest to the
 boathouse, as well as the Grafton Centre and the big Tesco and Asda superstores in east Cambridge.
 Number 24 also boasts a large kitchen well suited to social dining.

## Malcolm St

Malcolm Street has the pleasure of having the college at one end of the street, and a brewery and
 bar at the other. The east side of the street is mainly undergraduate, and the west, graduate.
 There are also a few couples’ units on  this street, with several having access to private gardens.
