There is a wide range of help and support services available to all students at the University.
The links on the right provide further information related to a variety of welfare issues, including details of people and services you can contact.
If you have any comments on these resources, or feel that we have missed something, please contact the Welfare Officers below. The members of the MCR Welfare team (welfare officers, international officer and LGBT liaison) can be contacted by email, pigeonhole, or in person. Their details can be found on the committee page.

Our <a href="http://mcr.jesus.cam.ac.uk/mcrwiki/index.php?title=Welfare" target="_blank">MCR wiki</a> has more information on where you can find help.

The Graduate Union and the Cambridge University Studentsâ€™ Union also provide Welfare advice:
