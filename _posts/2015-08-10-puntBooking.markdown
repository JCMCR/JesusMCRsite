The MCR has two seasons tickets for Scudamoreâ€™s which allows us to book a punt a day for FREE. The pass can only be used once per day, so only book the punt if you are certain you will be able to make it on that day.

The pass must also be shared amongst 300 grads. Please note that if you book the pass for sequential days it will be removed if someone complains. If you reserve a Saturday or Sunday for several weekends in a row, or book the punt for consecutive days over a weekend, your booking will be removed (any changes to a booking will be explained in an email to your Hermes account). The sports officer doesn't actively monitor the bookings, so please email mcr-sports@jesus.cam.ac.uk if you feel the card is being misused.

The porters will only give the card to the person that booked. If you fail to return the card, you are liable for the hire costs of the person using it after you.

You can email the Sports Officer if you want to make changes to a booking (mcr-sports@jesus.cam.ac.uk)
