Jesus College MCR site
====================

This theme is based on the [Agency bootstrap theme ](http://startbootstrap.com/templates/agency/)

# How to use

### Committee members

Change this in the `_config.yaml`. The images go in `image/team`.

### Posts

The 'services', gradcon and 3mt entries are all just posts. Use the categories to tell Jekyll where in the site to put them.

### Font awesome icons

fa icons are used extensively. While usually the fa gives this away, in the `_config.yaml` the contact details icons are also fa iccons with the fa stripped (meaning pretty much anything can be linked to).
