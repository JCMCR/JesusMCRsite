                    <p class="text-muted">The MCR (Middle Combination Room) is the graduate community within Jesus College. The aim of the MCR Committee is to represent the opinions and needs of graduate students to the College fellowship and the University, to maintain links with the Graduate Union and other MCRs, to facilitate the interaction of graduates with fellows, and perhaps most importantly to offer a wide range of social and academic opportunities targeted specifically towards the graduate community. The Committee also offers an initial point of contact if you have social or welfare issues and if we cannot help you directly we will refer you to the people who can!</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Within the College grounds is the MCR room. As well as being the room where your pigeonhole is (and therefore where your mail is delivered) we hope you will use this space regularly throughout your time at Jesus. The MCR room has a widescreen TV (with Freeview), a DVD player, an Xbox Kinect, a sound system, sofas and, perhaps most importantly, a coffee machine. We also have a selection of newspapers, magazines, fiction books from the library, board games, and a croquet set for your use.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">For more information about the MCR, College, and the city of Cambridge, please take a look at the MCR Wiki page (link opens a new tab/page). We hope that it will be able to answer many of the questions you might have regarding your arrival and study in Cambridge. If you have any questions, please do email someone on the MCR Committee!.</p>
